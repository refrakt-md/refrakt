## 0.14.4

### Patch Changes

- Framework adapter parity with the SvelteKit reference (SPEC-058) — six capabilities that previously lived only in `@refrakt-md/sveltekit` now ship in working form across `@refrakt-md/astro`, `@refrakt-md/nuxt`, `@refrakt-md/next`, `@refrakt-md/eleventy`, and `@refrakt-md/html`. Application work — no new contracts, no breaking changes.

  **Site-level token-overrides CSS now works in every adapter.** `composeSiteTokensCss` (the generator that turns `theme.presets`, `theme.tokens`, `theme.modes`, and `site.tints` into a stylesheet — SPEC-048 + SPEC-056) moved out of the SvelteKit plugin and into `@refrakt-md/transform/node` as a shared module. The Astro and Nuxt adapters expose it as a Vite virtual module (`virtual:refrakt/site-tokens.css`); Eleventy ships it as a passthrough-managed file; Next.js exposes it through a Server Component helper; the HTML renderer inlines it via a `page-shell` helper. Sites authored on any adapter can now drop tokens into `refrakt.config.json` and skip writing CSS for the common case, just like SvelteKit.

  **SEO meta enrichment from site config in every adapter.** `siteName`, `baseUrl`, `defaultImage`, and `logo` from `refrakt.config.json` now bake into `og:site_name`, absolute `og:url`, image fallback, and WebSite + Organization JSON-LD on every adapter, not just SvelteKit. `SeoToHtmlOptions` threads through the SEO helpers in Astro, Nuxt, Next, Eleventy, and HTML.

  **CSS tree-shaking by used-rune analysis everywhere.** The SvelteKit-only optimisation that emits only the per-rune CSS files for runes actually present in the corpus is now shared via `@refrakt-md/transform/node`'s `used-css` helper. Vite adapters (Astro, Nuxt) get it via a sibling `virtual:refrakt/runes.css` virtual module; non-Vite adapters (Eleventy, Next, HTML) get a `getUsedCssImports` companion. Sites stop shipping the full theme barrel on every framework.

  **Shared pipeline-stats build summary.** The Phase 1/2/3/4 + warnings table that the SvelteKit plugin printed at the end of every build moved into `@refrakt-md/content` and is adopted across every adapter's build path. Eleventy, Astro, Nuxt, and Next now surface the same build summary instead of going silent or inheriting the host framework's default output.

  **`security` and `variables` plugin options surfaced on every non-SvelteKit adapter.** `SecurityPolicy` and Markdoc `$name` variables were SvelteKit-only surfaces even though `loadContent` already accepted them. The Astro `createRefraktLoader`, Nuxt module, Next data helper, Eleventy plugin, and HTML renderer now all forward both options to the loader.

  **Content HMR for non-SvelteKit Vite adapters and Eleventy.** Content HMR (watching the content directory + sandbox examples, invalidating the loader cache on `.md` edits) extends to Astro + Nuxt via Vite `configureServer` and to Eleventy via `addWatchTarget`. The HMR machinery moved from `@refrakt-md/sveltekit` to `@refrakt-md/transform`'s `content-hmr` module so every adapter can reuse it. Next.js intentionally not covered — its dev server already invalidates the loader's import graph when watched files change. The HTML adapter is a static-build helper with no dev server.

  **`template-astro/src/setup.ts` replaced with `createRefraktLoader`.** The Astro starter template's bespoke setup boilerplate folds into a thin `createRefraktLoader` wrapper — the single entry point now handles loader construction, security/variables options, and the new HMR + tokens wiring. Same for the Next.js template's adapter glue.

  **Footer nav two-column mobile rule.** Cosmetic: footer nav drops to two columns on mobile instead of stacking to one, applies to both the auto-columns rendering and the explicit-column variant. Keeps the footer scannable on phone width where one-column footers turn into long scrolls.

## 0.14.3

### Patch Changes

- Navigation enrichment: build-time slug resolution + richer dropdowns (SPEC-054 + SPEC-055), `{% badge %}` core inline rune, and a docs IA split into separate author and developer handbooks.

  **SPEC-055: build-time slug resolution + active state.** `{% nav %}` slug references now resolve at build time rather than runtime, so the SSR HTML carries fully-resolved `href` attributes and the "multiple items active at once" symptom is gone. Multi-segment slugs (`docs/configuration/plugins`) are the first-class disambiguator when a leaf slug appears in multiple subtrees — ambiguous bare slugs raise a build error pointing at the offending nav with the candidates listed, instead of silently picking the wrong one. Active state is also computed at build time using exact + longest-prefix matching, with the active class stamped into the SSR HTML so there's no client-side flash. Lumina ships dedicated active-state styles; existing site navs migrated in-place to multi-segment slugs where bare slugs collided.

  **SPEC-054: richer dropdowns, column flow, and the strip layout.** `{% nav layout="menubar" %}` now accepts arbitrary block content inside `## groups`, with a position-based intro/footer slot rule: prose or runes appearing _before_ the first list become the panel intro, content appearing _after_ the list becomes the footer. `{% nav layout="columns" %}` gains a `---`-between-sections column-flow rule (each section becomes a column) plus a headingless mode where a flat list renders as a single-column card. A new `{% nav layout="strip" %}` lands for compact secondary link rows — flat by design; warns on `##` headings since grouped strip-like content should use `columns` or `vertical`. `layout="mega"` was explicitly _not_ added — menubar composition covers it via nested `columns` navs in panel slots.

  **`{% badge %}` core inline rune.** New core inline rune for compact metadata pills — sentiment variants (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, `neutral`), optional `icon` and `count` attributes. Styled with a sentiment-tinted border and background; standalone usage gets a punchier treatment than inline-in-prose. Lives in `packages/runes/src/tags/badge.ts` and `packages/lumina/styles/runes/badge.css`.

  **Auto-enrichment generalised across `auto=true` layouts.** Description and icon resolution (previously only on a subset of layouts) now applies to every `{% nav auto=true %}` invocation — the cross-page pipeline reads `description` and `icon` from each target page's frontmatter and injects them into the rendered nav item. Menubar panels, column navs, and the new strip layout all benefit. Backwards-compatible: omitting frontmatter just renders the title.

  **Mobile nav fix.** The mobile nav panel now docks below the header and is toggled by a single trigger that flips between open and close — the previous separate open/close buttons led to inconsistent state on rotation. The docs sidebar-nav panel offset was restored after it regressed during the menubar work, and the docs toolbar is now sticky on mobile so the breadcrumb stays visible while scrolling.

  **Docs toolbar breadcrumb.** Surfaces the category and current page title — gives the toolbar useful navigation context on deep pages where the URL alone isn't enough.

  **Docs IA split (WORK-238).** The site's docs tree now splits into two handbooks aimed at different audiences. **Docs** (`/docs/*`) is the author handbook — getting started, authoring, configuration, CLI, adapters, MCP. **Extend** (`/extend/*`) is the new developer handbook — rune authoring, plugin authoring, theme authoring, pipeline, security, contributing. Header restructured to five panels (Docs · Runes · Themes · Extend · Project); footer columns updated to match (Learn · Reference · Extend · Project). Old URLs (`/docs/authoring/*`, `/docs/themes/*`, `/docs/plugins/authoring*`, `/docs/security/*`) redirect to their new homes under `/extend/*`. A new author-facing plugin catalog landed at `/docs/configuration/plugins`. Internal cross-doc links, `CLAUDE.md`, and root READMEs swept to the new paths.

  **Hint rune visual cleanup.** Dropped the border on `{% hint %}` — the tinted surface alone separates it from surrounding prose, the extra border was visual noise.

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Curated syntax preset lineup phase 1 (SPEC-057) + tint-mode override fix on preset-extending tints + jsonc highlighter language.

  **Six imported syntax palettes.** New `@refrakt-md/lumina/presets/{dracula,solarized,catppuccin,tokyo-night,one-dark,gruvbox}` ship the six most widely-recognised community palettes as first-party presets, following the pattern established by Nord in v0.14.1. Dracula and One Dark are dark-only; Solarized, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, and Gruvbox carry both light and dark canvases. Each preset uses the SPEC-056 mechanism unchanged — a `ThemeTokensConfig` module with extended `SyntaxTokens` roles, opt-in `color.code.*` for canvas-claiming palettes, and live doc pages at `/themes/<name>` rendered through the scoped-tint mechanism. Application work only; no architectural changes.

  **Tint-mode override fix on preset-extending tints.** When a tint extended a preset module path (e.g. `tint="nord"` → `extends: '@refrakt-md/lumina/presets/nord'`), only the build-time scoped tint stylesheet knew about the preset and emitted `--rf-color-*` directly under `[data-tint="nord"]`. The runtime engine never saw the projected chrome accents because `presetMap` wasn't plumbed through `mergeThemeConfig` → `resolveTintExtends`, so no inline `--tint-*` styles were emitted on tinted elements — `tint.css`'s `[data-color-scheme][data-tint]` selectors collapsed to the colour scheme's neutral defaults regardless of the preset. `presetMap` now threads from the SvelteKit loader path through `assembleThemeConfig` and `mergeThemeConfig` into `resolveTintExtends`, so preset chrome accents land in `TintTokens` shape and the engine emits them as inline `--tint-*` styles. The static scoped tint stylesheet keeps emitting `--rf-color-*`; inline styles override on the same element exactly as `token-stylesheet.ts` already anticipated.

  **`jsonc` added to pre-loaded highlighter languages.** Config snippets across the preset doc pages (and other refrakt docs) use ` ```jsonc ` to fence JSON-with-comments. `jsonc` was intentional but not in Shiki's `DEFAULT_LANGS`, so the highlighter silently fell back to plain text. One-line add — Shiki ships `jsonc` as a bundled language.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Syntax token contract extension (SPEC-056) + diff/compare restyle + mobile and nav polish.

  **SPEC-056: tiered `SyntaxTokens` contract.** `SyntaxTokens` widens from 7 required + 2 optional roles to 7 required + 9 optional. The new optional roles (`type`, `property`, `parameter`, `tag`, `attribute`, `operator`, `number`, `regex`, `decorator`) let preset authors faithfully carry palettes that split distinctions the core collapses (Nord's Frost variants, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, etc.) while the core stays minimal. Each optional role emits a `var()` fallback chain in the generated CSS, so a preset that doesn't set an optional role still renders correctly — it just shares colour with its documented fallback (`type` → `function`, `property` → `variable`, `tag` → `keyword`, and so on).

  **Extended Shiki css-variables theme.** `@refrakt-md/highlight` now ships an extended css-variables theme that emits the new optional `--rf-syntax-token-*` variables alongside the existing seven. The alias derivation walks the TextMate scope tree to find the right hue for each optional role; presets that don't override a role get the fallback colour through the var() chain.

  **Nord preset module + canonical canvas.** New `@refrakt-md/lumina/presets/nord` ships Arctic Ice Studio's Nord as the first imported palette and the validation case for SPEC-056. The preset also claims the code surface — `theme.code.colorScheme` is `dark` and `color.code.*` projects Nord's canonical bg + fg — so canvas-claiming palettes can ship their full intended look together. Documented at `/themes/nord` with live `{% palette %}` blocks and a code showcase rendered through the scoped-tint mechanism.

  **Scoped tint projection from preset modules.** `theme.tints[].extends` now accepts preset module paths in addition to inline token shapes. When a tint extends a preset, the CSS generator projects the preset's scope-eligible namespaces (`syntax.*`, `color.code.*`, surface tints) into scoped CSS classes — `.rf-tint-nord` and friends — so a documentation page can render a live preset preview inside a page whose active preset is something else entirely. Powers the Nord doc page's live syntax showcase on a niwaki-themed site.

  **Diff + compare restyle.** `{% diff %}` drops the redundant "Before"/"After" labels above each split column (the red/green tints already carry the direction) in favour of an optional full-width header sourced from a new `title` attribute; when `title` is omitted, no header renders. Diff line markers are now a 3px coloured left border (`var(--rf-color-danger)` / `var(--rf-color-success)`) flush with the panel edge instead of an inset, with a slightly stronger background tint via `color-mix`. Equal and empty placeholder lines are both transparent — the previous gray wash on empty placeholders made split columns look like they had different background shades. The `+`/`-` glyph prefix is gone; coloured line numbers carry the directional cue. `{% compare %}` gains a matching `title` attribute that sits above the panels alongside the existing per-panel `labels` (those stay — they identify alternatives, not direction).

  **`theme.code.colorScheme` now cascades through code-bearing wrappers.** The highlight walk previously stamped `data-color-scheme` only on `<pre data-language>`, so the diff's outer `<pre data-name="code">` (which has no `data-language` — only its inner line-content spans do) never received the attribute and the override silently no-op'd on diffs. The walk now stamps the attribute on any `data-rune` wrapper that hosts a highlighted descendant, which generically covers diff, compare, codegroup, and any future code-bearing rune without per-rune knowledge in the transform.

  **Sidebar nav polish.** Collapsible nav groups now animate height transitions from JS (cross-browser consistent across mobile Safari and Firefox) instead of relying on `grid-template-rows` interpolation, which bounced on Firefox. Active items pick up a primary-tinted background instead of the neutral hover style. URL-aware auto-open is unchanged.

  **Mobile layout fixes.** Hero and CTA action rows now stack full-width below 640px instead of trying to fit side-by-side and overflowing. Table cells use a single mobile font-size so adjacent columns don't render at visibly different sizes on iOS. Mobile Safari's automatic text-size adjustment is disabled on `html` so the user's set font-size is respected.

### Patch Changes

- @refrakt-md/types@0.14.0

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 7471ad8: Rename "rune packages" to "plugins" and unify with CLI plugins. Plugins now contribute runes, layouts, theme config, pipeline hooks, behaviors, **and** CLI commands through a single npm package.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `RunePackage` interface → `Plugin`
  - `RunePackageEntry` → `PluginRune`
  - `RunePackageAttribute` → `PluginAttribute`
  - `RunePackageThemeConfig` → `PluginThemeConfig`
  - `PackagePipelineHooks` → `PluginPipelineHooks`
  - `loadRunePackage()` → `loadPlugin()`
  - `mergePackages()` → `mergePlugins()`
  - `discoverPackageFixtures()` → `discoverPluginFixtures()`
  - `LoadedPackage` → `LoadedPlugin`, `MergedPackageResult` → `MergedPluginResult`
  - `RuneProvenance.packageName` → `pluginName`; `source: 'package'` → `source: 'plugin'`
  - `RuneInfo.package` → `RuneInfo.plugin`; `SerializedRune.package` → `plugin`
  - Config field `site.packages[]` → `site.plugins[]`. The deprecated top-level shorthand `config.packages[]` is removed; use the existing `config.plugins[]` (which now covers both rune contributions and CLI commands).
  - `assembleThemeConfig` inputs renamed: `packageRunes` → `pluginRunes`, `packageIcons` → `pluginIcons`, `packageBackgrounds` → `pluginBackgrounds`.
  - `MergedPluginResult.packages` → `MergedPluginResult.plugins`
  - CLI: `refrakt package validate` removed; use `refrakt plugins validate` instead.
  - CLI: `refrakt reference list --package` flag is now `--plugin` (the old name still works as an alias).
  - Repo layout: `runes/{marketing,docs,…,plan}/` workspace globs moved to `plugins/{…}/`. npm package names (`@refrakt-md/marketing` etc.) are unchanged.

  **Migration:**

  - Rename `RunePackage` to `Plugin` and `loadRunePackage`/`mergePackages` to `loadPlugin`/`mergePlugins` in your code.
  - In `refrakt.config.json`, rename per-site `"packages": [...]` to `"plugins": [...]`. If you had a top-level `"packages"` shorthand under flat shape, move it to `"plugins"`.
  - Replace any calls to `refrakt package validate` with `refrakt plugins validate`.

- 7537459: v0.11.0 config follow-ups (WORK-176):

  - **Schema URL versioning.** The JSON Schema is now published at a versioned URL (`https://refrakt.md/schemas/v0.11/refrakt.config.schema.json`) with the unversioned URL kept as a "latest" alias. `create-refrakt` scaffolds derive the versioned URL from the package version at scaffold time so old projects don't get false validation errors when later releases add fields. Versioning policy documented in `site/content/docs/configuration/schema.md`.
  - **Optional mirrored fields.** `RefraktConfig.contentDir`, `theme`, and `target` are now typed as optional (`?:`) — they were strictly required strings before, which papered over the multi-site case where they're undefined. Adapter code that read these directly (`refrakt theme install`/`info`, `refrakt edit`, the Astro/HTML/SvelteKit scaffold templates) now goes through `resolveSite(config).site.contentDir` and friends.
  - **Flat-shape deprecation.** Loading a flat-shape `refrakt.config.json` (top-level `contentDir`/`theme`/`target` without a `site` wrapper) now emits a one-time deprecation warning per process. `refrakt config migrate` mentions the v1.0 removal target in its output. Docs (`overview.md`, `migration.md`, `sites.md`, `plugins.md`) replace flat-shape examples with the nested form and add `v0.12 → v1.0` deprecation callouts.
  - **`target` field downgraded to documentation-only.** No adapter actually validates or consumes `site.target`, so `SiteConfig.target` is now optional and the SvelteKit validator no longer requires it on flat-shape configs. The schema marks `target` `deprecated: true` with a note that it's slated for removal in v1.0.

### Patch Changes

- 799583f: Auto-migrate the legacy `packages` config field to `plugins` and emit a one-time deprecation warning. The field was renamed in v0.12.0 when rune packages and CLI plugins were unified, but the parser was silently ignoring the legacy field rather than warning, which broke sites that still used `sites.X.packages`. The legacy field now auto-migrates with a console warning and will be removed in v1.0.

### Minor Changes

- 6a89ebe: v0.11.0 — unified config + multi-site + MCP server.

  - **Unified `refrakt.config.json`**. New `$schema`, `plugins`, `plan`, `site` / `sites` sections collapsed into a canonical sites map by `normalizeRefraktConfig()` in `@refrakt-md/transform/node`. Flat / singular / plural shapes all valid; single-site fields mirror to the top level for backwards compat. JSON Schema published from `@refrakt-md/transform` and referenced from a repo-root symlink for in-repo `$schema` references.
  - **Plugin discovery**. `discoverPlugins()` in `@refrakt-md/cli/lib/plugins` resolves `config.plugins` first, then falls back to scanning `package.json` deps + `node_modules/@refrakt-md/*`. CLI dispatch uses it for routing, "Did you mean?" suggestions on misspellings, and `--help` plugin listing. New `refrakt plugins list` command.
  - **Multi-site support**. New `--site <name>` flag on site-scoped commands (`inspect`, `contracts`, `scaffold-css`, `validate`, `package validate`). Resolves via `resolveSite()`; multi-site without `--site` errors with available names; unknown name errors with a suggestion. All five framework adapters (`sveltekit`, `astro`, `nuxt`, `next`, `eleventy`) accept a `site?: string` option.
  - **`@refrakt-md/mcp`** (new package). Model Context Protocol server wrapping the refrakt CLI. Stdio transport, six core tools (`refrakt.detect`, `refrakt.plugins_list`, `refrakt.reference`, `refrakt.contracts`, `refrakt.inspect`, `refrakt.inspect_list`), plugin-discovered tools registered as `<namespace>.<name>`, and read-only resources (`refrakt://detect`, `refrakt://plan/index`, `refrakt://plan/<type>/<id>`, etc.). Errors return structured envelopes with `errorCode` + `hint`. `--cwd <path>` overrides cwd. Long-running commands (`plan.serve`, `plan.build`) intentionally excluded.
  - **Plan + MCP integration**. New `inputSchema` / `outputSchema` / `mcpHandler` fields on `CliPluginCommand`. Plan commands ship MCP bindings (`next`, `update`, `create`, `status`, `validate`, `next-id`, `init`, `history`, `migrate`). Plan package consumes the unified config via `resolvePlanDir()` (precedence: flag → env → config → `'plan'`). `plan init` scaffolds `refrakt.config.json` by default (`--no-config` opts out).
  - **`refrakt config migrate`**. New subcommand. Default is dry-run with a line diff; `--apply` writes. `--to nested` (default) handles flat → singular; `--to multi-site --name <n>` handles singular → plural. Idempotent. Auto-populates `plugins` from `discoverPlugins()` on first migration.
  - **`.mcp.json` scaffolding**. `plan init` and `create-refrakt` (all six site scaffolds) drop a project-scoped `.mcp.json` registering `@refrakt-md/mcp` for MCP-aware agents (Claude Code, Cursor). Gated on agent detection; `--no-mcp` opts out.
  - **Site docs**. New `site/content/docs/configuration/` (overview, plugins, plan, sites, migration, schema) and `site/content/docs/mcp/` (overview, installation, tools, resources, errors). `packages/authoring.md` extended with an "Adding CLI Commands and MCP Tools" section. `CLAUDE.md` gains an MCP section directing agents to prefer MCP tools over the CLI when both are available.
  - **Path resolution semantics**. Nested-shape paths (`contentDir`, `sandbox.examplesDir`, `theme`, `overrides`, `runes.local`) now resolve relative to the config file's directory when a `configDir` is provided to `normalizeRefraktConfig()`. Flat-shape paths remain cwd-relative for legacy projects. `DEFAULT_SITE_NAME` exported as `'main'` (was `'default'`) so flat / singular configs promote to `sites.main` and match the `create-refrakt` scaffolds.

  Fix duplicate BEM classes on runes nested inside `data-name` elements. Make
  `autoLabel` recursive in the identity transform engine so eyebrow, headline, and
  blurb children inside `<header>` wrappers receive BEM classes. Add
  `pageSectionAutoLabel` to all marketing and core page-section runes.

  Add pill-badge eyebrow variant: an eyebrow paragraph containing a link renders as
  a rounded pill with a border, muted prose text, and primary-colored link. The
  entire pill is clickable via a CSS `::before` overlay.

  Add `mockup` rune to `@refrakt-md/design` for wrapping content in device frames.

  Fix multiple preview runtime issues: `structuredClone` errors, `DataCloneError`
  when sending `routeRules` via `postMessage`, and cache not invalidating on source
  changes. Remove `ComponentType` and `PropertyNodes` from the schema system.

### Minor Changes

- ### Theme Development Toolkit

  - **`refrakt scaffold --theme`** generates a complete custom theme with layout, CSS tokens, manifest, test infrastructure, and kitchen sink content
  - **`refrakt inspect`** command for theme developers — rune coverage audit, CSS audit, structure contracts
  - **`refrakt inspect --contracts`** generates HTML structure contracts (`structures.json`) for all 74 runes
  - Theme scaffold produces full `SvelteTheme` runtime integration (manifest, layouts, components, elements)
  - CSS entry points: `base.css` (tokens-only), `svelte/tokens.css` (dev bridge), `styles/runes/*.css` (tree-shakable)

  ### Behaviors Library

  - **`@refrakt-md/behaviors`** — vanilla JS progressive enhancement via `data-rune` attributes
  - Tabs, accordion/reveal, datatable, form, copy-to-clipboard, and preview behaviors
  - Framework-agnostic: works with any renderer, no Svelte dependency

  ### Theme Base Package

  - **`@refrakt-md/theme-base`** — extracted universal rune config, interactive components, and structural CSS
  - 74 rune configurations in identity transform engine
  - Enables multi-theme support with shared component registry

  ### Identity Transform Expansion

  - Moved 8+ Svelte components to pure CSS/identity transform + behaviors
  - `styles`, `staticModifiers`, `postTransform` engine capabilities
  - Context-aware BEM modifiers
  - Design runes (palette, typography, spacing) moved to identity layer
  - Blockquote as CSS-only implementation
  - Migrated all components to `--rf-*` prefixed tokens (removed `aliases.css`)

  ### New Runes

  - **`symbol`** — code construct documentation (functions, classes, interfaces)
  - **`preview`** — component showcase with theme toggle, code/preview tabs, responsive viewports
  - **`sandbox`** — live HTML playground with iframe isolation
  - **`map`** — interactive location visualizations
  - **`design-context`** — token extraction and sandbox injection
  - Standalone design runes: swatch, palette, typography, spacing
