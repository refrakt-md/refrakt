# Welcome to refract.md

A content framework that extends Markdown with semantic runes — structured components that transform plain Markdown primitives into rich, typed content.

{% hint type="note" %}
This site is built with refract.md itself. Every page you see is authored in Markdown with runes.
{% /hint %}

## What are runes?

Runes are Markdoc tags that reinterpret standard Markdown elements within their context. A heading inside a `{% nav %}` becomes a navigation group title. A list inside a `{% cta %}` becomes action items. The same Markdown primitives take different semantic meaning depending on the wrapping rune.

## Getting Started
