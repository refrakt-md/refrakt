We're excited to launch the refrakt.md blog. This is where we'll share project updates, deep dives into the architecture, and practical tutorials for building content-driven sites with Markdoc.

## Why a blog?

Documentation covers the *how*. A blog covers the *why* and the *what's next*. We want a space to talk about design decisions, share patterns we've discovered, and highlight what the community is building.

## What to expect

We'll be writing about:

- **Architecture decisions** -- the reasoning behind runes, the identity transform, and the content/theme separation
- **Tutorials** -- step-by-step guides for common patterns
- **Release notes** -- detailed breakdowns of what's new in each version

Stay tuned for more posts. In the meantime, check out the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started) to start building.
