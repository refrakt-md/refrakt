# Content & Routing

This page covers how refrakt.md turns a directory of Markdown files into a routed site — frontmatter fields, URL generation, the layout cascade, and content organization.

## Frontmatter

Every Markdown file can have YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters:

```markdoc
---
title: My Page
description: A short summary for SEO and navigation
---

Page content starts here.
```

### Supported fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | Page title — used in navigation, breadcrumbs, and `<title>` |
| `description` | `string` | Page description — used for SEO meta tags and page summaries |
| `slug` | `string` | Custom URL override (see [Routing](#routing) below) |
| `draft` | `boolean` | Marks the page as a draft (see [Drafts](#drafts) below) |
| `redirect` | `string` | Redirect target URL — the page generates a redirect instead of normal content |
| `order` | `number` | Controls sort position in navigation and pagination |
| `date` | `string` | Publication date (ISO 8601 format, e.g., `2025-03-15`) |
| `author` | `string` | Content author name |
| `tags` | `string[]` | Array of content tags |
| `image` | `string` | Featured image URL — used for social sharing and page cards |

All fields are optional. You can also add arbitrary custom fields — they're accessible to runes and pipeline hooks.

## Routing

URLs are derived from file paths with three transformations applied in order:

1. The `.md` extension is stripped
2. `index.md` files become the directory root (e.g., `docs/index.md` → `/docs/`)
3. Numeric prefixes on path segments are stripped (e.g., `01-getting-started.md` → `/getting-started`)

### Examples

| File path | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| `index.md` | `/` |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `/docs/getting-started` |
| `docs/index.md` | `/docs/` |
| `blog/01-first-post.md` | `/blog/first-post` |

### Slug overrides

The `slug` frontmatter field overrides the computed URL:

```yaml
---
slug: /custom/path
---
```

- **Absolute slugs** (starting with `/`) replace the entire URL
- **Relative slugs** are prefixed with the base path

### Route rules

The `routeRules` field in `refrakt.config.json` maps URL patterns to theme layouts. Rules are evaluated in order — first match wins:

```json
{
  "routeRules": [
    { "pattern": "docs/**", "layout": "docsLayout" },
    { "pattern": "blog/**", "layout": "blogArticleLayout" },
    { "pattern": "**", "layout": "defaultLayout" }
  ]
}
```

Route rules control which **theme layout** (the framework-level page shell) wraps the page. They're separate from the content layout cascade described below.

## Layout cascade

Layouts are defined in `_layout.md` files that cascade down directory trees. Every page inherits from all `_layout.md` files in its ancestor directories, from the content root down to its own directory.

### How inheritance works

Given this structure:

```
content/
├── _layout.md          ← root layout
├── index.md
└── docs/
    ├── _layout.md      ← docs layout
    ├── getting-started.md
    └── guides/
        ├── _layout.md  ← guides layout
        └── intro.md
```

The page `docs/guides/intro.md` inherits from three layouts in order:

1. `content/_layout.md` (root)
2. `content/docs/_layout.md` (docs)
3. `content/docs/guides/_layout.md` (guides)

### Regions

Layouts define named regions using the `{% layout %}` and `{% region %}` runes:

```markdoc
{% layout %}
{% region name="header" %}
# My Site
{% /region %}

{% region name="nav" %}
{% nav %}
## Docs
- getting-started
{% /nav %}
{% /region %}
{% /layout %}
```

### Region merge modes

When a child layout defines a region that already exists in a parent, the `mode` attribute controls how they combine:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `replace` | Child region replaces the parent's (default) |
| `prepend` | Child content is prepended before the parent's |
| `append` | Child content is appended after the parent's |

```markdoc
{% region name="nav" mode="append" %}
## Extra Section
- new-page
{% /region %}
```

This appends additional navigation items to the inherited nav region.

## Drafts

Setting `draft: true` in frontmatter marks a page as a draft:

```yaml
---
title: Work in Progress
draft: true
---
```

Draft pages are still processed and included in the content tree, but the draft flag is preserved in the page data. How drafts are handled depends on the adapter — typically they're visible in dev mode but excluded from production builds.

## Redirects

The `redirect` field generates a redirect from the current URL to the target:

```yaml
---
title: Old Page
redirect: /new-location
---
```

The page is still processed but adapters emit the appropriate redirect mechanism (HTTP redirect, meta refresh, etc.) instead of rendering the page content.

## Navigation ordering

The `order` field controls where a page appears in navigation lists and sequential pagination:

```yaml
---
title: Introduction
order: 1
---
```

Pages with `order` are sorted numerically. Pages without `order` fall back to alphabetical sorting by file path. Numeric prefixes in file names (e.g., `01-intro.md`) are stripped from URLs but do **not** set `order` — use the frontmatter field for explicit control.

## Partials

Reusable content blocks can be defined in a `_partials/` directory and included in any page. See [Partials](/docs/authoring/partials) for details.
