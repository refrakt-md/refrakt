# CTA

Call-to-action sections. Headings become the hero headline, paragraphs become the subtitle, and list items with links become action buttons.

```markdoc
{% cta %}
# Your Headline

A compelling description of what you're offering.

- [Primary Action](/signup)
- [Secondary Action](/learn)
{% /cta %}
```

### Example

{% cta %}
# Get Started with refract.md

Build structured content sites with semantic Markdown.

- [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started)
- [View on GitHub](https://github.com)
{% /cta %}

Code fences become copyable command blocks:

```markdoc
{% cta %}
# Install refract.md

\`\`\`shell
npm install @refract-md/runes
\`\`\`
{% /cta %}
```
