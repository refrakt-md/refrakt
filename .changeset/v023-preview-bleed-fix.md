**Fix: `preview` no longer bleeds to the viewport edge inside a `feature` (default layout).** The WORK-438 skeleton/skin split promoted the in-feature breakout `.rf-preview--in-feature { margin-inline: calc(-1 * var(--rf-content-gutter)) }` into `@layer skeleton`, where it lost to Lumina's skin rule `.rf-preview { margin: 2rem 0 }` (skin beats skeleton regardless of specificity), nullifying the breakout. The bleed is moved back to `@layer skin`, where it again wins over the base margin by specificity and fires together with the canvas border-radius reset at the `@container (max-width: 1280px)` breakpoint. Docs-layout previews were unaffected (they bleed via the canvas de-chrome, not the in-feature root margin).
