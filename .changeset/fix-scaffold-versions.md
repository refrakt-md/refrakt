Fix scaffolded dependency versions to derive from package version at runtime instead of hardcoding. Previously, the template hardcoded `^0.4.0` which with 0.x semver resolved to `<0.5.0`, causing newly scaffolded sites to install incompatible older packages. Also fixes invalid rune attribute usage in the kitchen sink template.
