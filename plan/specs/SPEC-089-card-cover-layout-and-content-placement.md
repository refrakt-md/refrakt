# Card cover layout: `media-position="cover"`, content placement, and intrinsic height

A media+content rune (`card`, `bento-cell`) normally lays its media and content in
**separate, non-overlapping tracks** — `media-position="top|bottom|start|end"`. This
spec adds a `cover` layout mode where the **media fills the rune's interior and the
content overlays it** — the poster / cover card — preserving the thin-edge frame and
media radius, with a content-placement control, a default legibility scrim, and an
intrinsic-height answer for both cover and `bg`-only cards. It was battle-tested against
a profile-card example (a normal media-top card vs the same card with the media pulled
down to cover, text overlaid).

## Overview

### Cover is a media-slot *layout mode*, not `bg`

The decisive clue is that the image keeps the card's **thin-edge frame** and **media
radius** — it reads as *the media well pulled down to fill the card*, with content
floated on top, not as an edge-to-edge background. So the image is still the rune's
**media guest**; `cover` is a one-attribute toggle on the *same content*
(`media-position: top → cover`), not a content restructure into `bg`.

This refines the {% ref "SPEC-087" /%} §4 boundary: **when the image is the rune's media
(the subject), it stays a media guest in `cover` mode; when it is decorative ambiance
behind content, it is `bg`.** Two reasons `cover` beats `bg` for the media case:

- **Framing reuse** — the thin-edge inset (`--rf-card-edge`) + `--rf-radius-media` already produce the framed look on a normal card; `cover` just lets the media well span the full interior. `bg` is edge-to-edge and out of flow.
- **Height for free** — the media is **in-flow**, so its aspect-ratio defines the card's height (no shrink). A `bg` is `position: absolute` and contributes no height (see §4).

## Design

### 1. `media-position="cover"`

- The media well spans the rune's full interior (inside the thin edge, with `--rf-radius-media`); the content block is positioned **over** it (not in a separate track).
- Height comes from the media's aspect-ratio — `frame-aspect` ({% ref "SPEC-086" /%}) or the card height/aspect knob (§4) — with a **sensible portrait default** (e.g. `3/4`) so the tall look works with zero config.
- Applies to media+content runes (`card`, `bento-cell`). `bento-cell` already gets height from grid row-spans; the standalone card relies on §4.

### 2. `content-place` — the overlay anchor

- **Active only in `cover` mode.** In the non-cover layouts content sits in its own non-overlapping track — there is no overlay to anchor — so `content-place` outside `cover` is inert and emits a build warning (SPEC-084 validation). Aligning content *within* a flow track is a separate `valign`-style concern, deliberately not conflated here.
- **2-axis logical grammar**, mirroring CSS `place-content` and the frame `place` (block × inline): `start | center | end` on each axis. `content-place="end"` = block-end (bottom); `content-place="end start"` = bottom-left. **Default `end`** (bottom). Logical (not physical `top/left`) for RTL/writing-mode safety; physical names may exist as friendly aliases. Maps to `justify`/`align` of the overlaid content block.
- **Orientation-adaptive default.** Logical values resolve against writing-mode, *not* the card's aspect ratio, so a single value can't mean "bottom when portrait, side when landscape." Because the media zone is a container-query context (WORK-339), `content-place="auto"` (the cover default) adapts on the rune's own aspect: **portrait → `block-end`; landscape → `inline-start`** (`@container (min-aspect-ratio: 1/1)`). An explicit `content-place` pins it and opts out.

### 3. Scrim in cover mode

- **On by default.** Overlaying text on an arbitrary image without a scrim is a legibility footgun, so `cover` applies a default scrim. `scrim="none"` opts out (author takes responsibility).
- **Targets the media surface.** In `cover` the text overlays the media well, so the scrim is a legibility treatment over the *media* surface — using the {% ref "SPEC-087" /%} self/media targeting (the bg-layer scrim and the media-well scrim are the same facet on different surfaces).
- **Direction follows `content-place`** by default (the scrim belongs where the text is); independently overridable. The scrim **region tracks the content area** (it grows with the content and re-anchors when `content-place` moves) — frost's panel *is* the content box; a gradient's falloff anchors to the content edge, not a fixed band.
- The scrim *facet* itself — `type` (`gradient`/`frost`), `strength`, `blur`, `tone` — is defined in {% ref "SPEC-088" /%}; `cover` mode only turns it on and binds its direction to `content-place`.

### 4. Intrinsic height

- **Cover cards** — solved by §1: in-flow media + aspect-ratio (default portrait), no collapse.
- **`bg`-only cards** (decorative backdrop, no media guest) — `bg` is `position: absolute; inset: 0`, out of flow, so the card **collapses to content height**. Add a card intrinsic-height knob: a named-scale `height` (`sm|md|lg|xl`) and/or an `aspect` attribute. This is the **standalone analog of bento's row-spans** — a `bento-cell` takes its height from the grid track, but a standalone `card` has no grid to lean on and needs its own intrinsic height.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `media-position` gains `cover`: the media well fills the rune interior (thin-edge frame + `--rf-radius-media` preserved) and content overlays it; switching a card from `top`/`bottom`/`start`/`end` to `cover` is a one-attribute change on the same content.
- [ ] In `cover` mode height comes from the media aspect-ratio (`frame-aspect`, default portrait), so the rune does not collapse; the media is in-flow and content overlays it.
- [ ] `content-place` positions the overlay: 2-axis logical (`start|center|end` × `start|center|end`), default `end`; active only in `cover` mode and a build warning otherwise.
- [ ] `content-place="auto"` (the cover default) adapts to the rune's container-query orientation (portrait → `block-end`, landscape → `inline-start`); an explicit value pins it.
- [ ] A default scrim is applied in `cover` mode, targeting the **media** surface (SPEC-087 routing), its direction following `content-place` and independently overridable (`scrim="none"` disables); the scrim region tracks the content area.
- [ ] A card intrinsic-height knob (named-scale `height` + `aspect`) preserves height for `bg`-only cards (no in-flow media); documented as the standalone analog of bento row-spans.
- [ ] Docs: the `card` reference documents `cover` mode, `content-place`, the cover scrim default, and card height; cross-linked with {% ref "SPEC-087" /%}, {% ref "SPEC-088" /%}, {% ref "SPEC-086" /%}.

## Work breakdown (provisional)

1. **`cover` layout** — media fills interior (reuse `--rf-card-edge` / `--rf-radius-media`), content overlay; default portrait aspect.
2. **`content-place`** — logical 2-axis mapping to `justify`/`align`; orientation-adaptive `auto` via container query; warn outside `cover`.
3. **Cover scrim default** — media-surface target, follows `content-place`, region tracks content; consumes the {% ref "SPEC-088" /%} scrim facet.
4. **Card intrinsic height/aspect knob** — named-scale `height` + `aspect`.
5. **Docs** — `card` reference + cross-links.
